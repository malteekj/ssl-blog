# Self-Supervised Log 
This log is intended to offer an overview of self-supervised deep learning. Many great blog posts exist on different aspects of self-supervised learning, but this log aims at collecting the information one place, in a wiki-style resource. Right now I am documenting my own learning journey through the field, but the hope is to have it as a crowd-sourced page, were experts in each branch of self-supervised learning can share their knowledge and let the community benefit from their experience, as well as showcasing their knowledge about their field.
